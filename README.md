Hackathon / Remote RubberDuck Buddy

Idea

Implement an Online Version of a Rubber Duck! Where the Duck is a real person impersonated by a Duck face.
This is an extension of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging.

Features

- People should be able to join and a name alias will be generated for them
- People can join and create a help channel where they can play the role of Driver or Navigator (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming)
- The Navigator voice needs to be a processed voice for complete anonymity
- The Duck face should have some expressions as the person speaks
- The Driver shares his screen only
